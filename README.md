# Matlab-GUI
a MATLAB GUI created to perform simple calculations about the discharge of a defibillator. The GUI will take in user inputs 
for voltage and power, and use numerical integration methods to output a graph is showing the various data points. With a checkbox
pressed, the amount of Joules that the discharge has is also outputted. The GUI contains a warning box, that will state the errors, if
any, that are present in the inputs from the user.
